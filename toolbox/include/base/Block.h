/**
 * @brief Basic abstract class for wrapping generic algorithms
 *
 * ### Rationale
 *
 * This class is aimed to wrap generic algorithms and it represents the most basic component of
 * `WB-Toolbox`.
 *
 * The entire execution of an generic algorithm can be split in the following major steps:
 *
 * - Initialization: implemented with Block::configureSizeAndPorts, Block::initialize
 * - Execution: implemented with Block::output
 * - Termination: implemented with Block::terminate
 *
 * Considering that the main aim of this toolbox at its beginning was its integration with Simulink,
 * it contains other methods for exposing the algorithm as a Simulink block.
 *
 * ### Main concept
 *
 * A generic application is the composition of many algorithms sharing and processing each other
 * data. Every algorithm is represented by a wbt::Block, and the data shared with other blocks is
 * carried by wbt::Signal.
 *
 * The block is generally unaware of the data that it will process, and it is only interested in
 * knowing how many input / output signals are connected, their size and data type. Blocks have the
 * concept of _ports_, which are the connections between external wbt::Signal and the block itself.
 *
 * @remark A signal can be plugged to more than one port.
 *
 * This kind of information is set by a wbt::BlockInformation object, and it can be specific to the
 * framework where the algorithm runs (e.g. standalone C++ code, Simulink, etc).
 *
 * Beyond this, an algorithm often needs parameters. This class provides functionalities to gather
 * them in a wbt::Parameters object.
 *
 * ### Other information
 *
 * You can create a new block by deriving this class and implementing at least all the pure virtual
 * methods.
 *
 * @note This class and the entire toolbox assume that algorithms are represented as instantaneous
 *       systems, there is no default storage capability between different sampling times. However,
 *       blocks can wrap generic classes which can retain data, outsourcing data persistence outside
 *       the framework given by `WB-Toolbox`.
 * \par
 * @note Despite some of the methods inside this class looks Simulink-dependent, objects of this
 *       class are completely generic. In fact, it only provides algorithm callbacks, and the
 *       setting of input / output data is demanded to the wbt::BlockInformation interface. For what
 *       concerns Simulink, a wbt::SimulinkBlockInformation implementation is provided.
 * \par
 *
 * @see wbt::BlockInformation Class for providing information about signals and parameters.
 * @see wbt::WBBlock Specialization of wbt::Block which provides useful resources for developing
 *      whole-body blocks.
