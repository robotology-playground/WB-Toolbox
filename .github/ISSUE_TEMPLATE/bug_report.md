- [ ] I already updated to the latest version I can use
- [ ] I already checked similar issues using the search box
- [ ] I already checked the website for known troubleshooting
- [ ] I already cleaned my environment (by removing the wb-toolbox install folder and installing it again)
- [ ] I already excluded the possibility that system configuration files (e.g. yarp related) might be responsible
- [ ] I am sure the environment variables are correct
- [ ] I tried to reproduce the error in simulation (if it affects the real robot)

#### Description

A clear and concise description of what the bug is and what should be the expected behavior.

#### Platform

Specify if the bug affects a robot controller and if it happens in simulation, on the real device, or on both.

#### Reproducibility

Describe the steps for reproducing the behavior. If possible, upload a simple Simulink model (only if the error does not either involve the real robot or it is reproducible in simulation).

1. First step
2. Second step
3. ...

#### Screenshots

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem (e.g. Simulink Model, Scopes, etc.)

#### Additional information

- OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 / Windows 10 / macOS High Sierra]
- Version / Commit: [e.g. `v4.0`]
- Matlab Version: [e.g. `2018a`]

#### Additional context
